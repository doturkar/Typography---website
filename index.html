  <h1>What is Web Typography</h1>
  <p>
    Wikipedia defines Web typography as anything that “refers to the use of fonts on the Web.”
    The article explains that web browsers controlled the look of fonts and styles until 1995,
    when Netscape introduced the <font> tag in HTML 2. Now most browsers automatically download fonts and designers have
      greater freedom to design with type on the web.

    Every designer has his or her own method for integrating text in to websites.
    Some designers do it with their end users in mind and make their text easy to read.
    Other designers opt to use small text or unreadable fonts because of other design constraints. Personally I would
    rather not
    include text than have it unreadable. Learning the following web typography tips and integrating them into your
    sites you will
    be able to layout your copy like an expert.All of the tips are very easy to use and easier to implement.
    The hardest part is remembering to use them.
